## Getting Started

Ensure you have nodejs and docker installed on your workstation.

```
# start postgres in a docker container
docker compose up -d

# install dependencies
npm install

# setup database
npm run db

# boot up the app
npm run dev
```

See your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Environment

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project. Add the following environment variable.

```
# setup SSO with Google
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# setup SSO with Twitter
TWITTER_API_KEY=
TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=

```

### Migrations

Follow the [Prisma guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/developing-with-prisma-migrate) on adjusting the database through migrations. Once the Prisma schema has been adjusted run `npm run migrate`.

## Release
The starter is designed to be deployed to [render](https://render.com) using their Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configuration file [render.yaml](/render.yaml). The IaC manifest will set up a web server for the mint page and a database for storing users, sessions, and wallets.

### Database
After deploying the environment, access the shell of the web server and run the following command to create and set up the database schema:

```
npm run db
```

### Environment Variables
Although the IaC will create placeholder environment variables for the web service, you will need to update them to match your Holaplex account.
